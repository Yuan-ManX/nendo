## GPU support

Most of the libraries polymath uses come with native GPU support through cuda. Please follow the [tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) for instructions on how to set up use with cuda. If you have followed these steps, tensorflow and torch will both automatically pick up the GPU and use it.
